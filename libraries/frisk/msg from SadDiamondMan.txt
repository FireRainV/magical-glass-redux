    // The party. The first character is the player.
    "party": ["kris", "susie", "ralsei"],

    // The party. The first character is the player.
    "party": ["frisk"],

the dark world sprites are based off the twin runes comics frisk by Akanemnon on tumblur dot com

{{I made the sprites so do not upload them to the spriters resource without asking for i have not asked Akanemnon if im allowed to use the design}}
